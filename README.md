# GroceryBoone

This web map was created for a lab in my Web Mapping class. I named the project GroceryBoone because it is a web map that shows some of the grocery stores in the Boone area. The map has outlines of the municipality boundaries of Boone and Blowing Rock. The basemap was retrieved from CartoDB, and I used multiple libraries such as leaflet and jquery. The main source I used to obtain information for this project was google maps. I looked up grocery stores in Boone and then used the coordinate information to create a csv file that I could turn into a GeoJson file through geojson.io. For the Watauga Municipalities, I obtained a shapefile from NC Onemap. This shapefile included all the municipalities in the state, however I only needed Boone and Blowing Rock. I removed the polygons I did not need in QGIS, and then turned the shapefile into a geoJson.
